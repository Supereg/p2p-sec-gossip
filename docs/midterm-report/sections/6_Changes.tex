\section{Changes}\label{sec:objective}

With the current project state, we didn't identify any severe deviations from the project architecture
we anticipated in the initial report.

However, there were slight changes in the list of dependencies we used within the project.
Namely, we added the following new dependencies:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \textbf{Guava}\footnote{https://guava.dev} is a commonly used utility library developed by Google, which
    we use in several locations.
    \item \textbf{Caffeine}\footnote{https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine} is a high-performance, near-optimal
    caching library that builds upon the Guava Cache API\@.
    We use it within the \ttt{GossipModule} for data structures to enforce a time- or
    space-based expiry on its contents.
    \item \textbf{commons-cli}\footnote{https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/} is a library from the
    Apache Software Foundation to parse command-line options in Java applications easily.
\end{itemize}
