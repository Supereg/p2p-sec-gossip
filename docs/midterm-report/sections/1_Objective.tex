\section{Objective}\label{sec:objective2}

This paper details our intermediate progress on the progress of the \textit{Gossip-10} team project as part of the
\textit{Peer-to-Peer Systems and Security} course.
The Gossip module is part of the \textit{VoidPhone} Voice over IP system.
VoidPhone provides anonymity and unobservability to voice communication facilitated through a peer-to-peer architecture.
The Gossip module is used to spread information like availability information among communicating peers.
Other modules from other teams might rely on the Gossip module to spread information required for their operations
through the network.
For this purpose, the project specification defines a socket-layer API for inter-module communication.
The protocol spoken between Gossip instances is the core product of this project work.
We follow the material and contents taught in the lecture -- considering best practices, common attacks, and security measures --
for the instantiation of our P2P protocol.
