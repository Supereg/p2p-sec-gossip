\subsection{API Interface}\label{subsec:api-interface}

The \textbf{API Interface} implements the TCP socket-based API used by other modules to interact with Gossip (see \autoref{sec:requirements}).
Packet definitions are provided for the four API messages
\ttt{ANNOUNCE}, \ttt{NOTIFY}, \ttt{NOTIFICATION}, and \ttt{VALIDATION}, as outlined in the specification.
The component relies on the networking abstractions introduced in \autoref{subsec:networking}.

Incoming API message calls are forwarded to the \ttt{GossipModule}, which is part of the \textit{Gossip Protocol} component.
The module is provided with a connection handle to send out potential notifications later.
